# Credit Risk Modeling using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project builds an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict
credit risk (loan default) using historical customer data.

The objective is to help financial institutions identify high-risk applicants
and reduce loan default rates.
